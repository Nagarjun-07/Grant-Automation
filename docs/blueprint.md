# **App Name**: BioMetallica Agent

## Core Features:

- File Processing: Process uploaded PDF or image files containing bioreactor technical data to extract text.
- LLM Insight Analysis: Use a Large Language Model tool to summarize and analyze technical documentation, creating a concise briefing.
- TRL Breakdown: Assess the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of various bioreactor components using LLM reasoning, providing justification and timestamp for each assessment.
- Validation and Risks Analysis: Generate experimental validation suggestions and identify potential risks in the technical content of the bioreactor documentation.
- R&D Pipeline Generation: Generate an R&D roadmap for the bioreactor system, outlining key phases from lab to deployment.
- Unit Economics Simulation: Simulate economic performance based on provided scale parameters (production_scale, cost_per_unit, revenue_per_unit).
- Grant Search: Search public grant databases (e.g., grants.gov) using provided keywords (e.g., ['bioreactor', 'research']) and optional filters (e.g., {'min_funding': 5000}).
- Custom Proposal Generation: Generate a tailored grant proposal based on grant details (e.g., title, funding), past proposals, and a project summary. Include sections: Title, Introduction, Objectives, Methodology, Budget, and Conclusion.
- Report Display: Display summarized bioreactor system reports in a clear and structured format.
- Document Upload and Viewing: Enable users to upload documents and view the analysis results within the application.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep indigo (#4B0082) to convey expertise and sophistication.
- Background color: Very light lavender (#F0F8FF), providing a clean and modern backdrop.
- Accent color: Muted gold (#B8860B) to highlight important sections and interactive elements, symbolizing knowledge and insights.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for a techy, scientific feel.
- Body font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) to ensure readability.
- Use scientific and data-driven icons related to bioreactor technology, with a minimalist outline style.
- Design a clean, well-structured layout with clear sections for document uploading, report viewing, and interactive elements.
